# Motion-Detection

Motion Detection
Overview

This project is a motion detection system built in Python, designed to monitor real-time video feeds and detect movement effectively. By leveraging OpenCV, this project captures video frames, processes them, and highlights any detected movement, making it suitable for applications in security systems, wildlife monitoring, and general surveillance.
Features

    Real-Time Motion Detection: Processes video feed continuously to detect movement.
    Frame Differencing: Employs frame differencing to identify changes in the video, detecting subtle movements.
    Highlighting Movements: Draws bounding boxes around moving objects to visually emphasize detected motion.
    Easy Setup and Use: Simple to implement on any device with a camera and Python installed.

Project Motivation

As security concerns grow, having an efficient and cost-effective motion detection system can provide peace of mind. This project demonstrates an easily customizable solution for various security and monitoring needs, showcasing my skills in computer vision and Python programming.
Technology Stack

    Python: Core programming language for logic and data handling.
    OpenCV: For capturing, processing, and manipulating video frames.

Setup Instructions

    Clone this repository:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/Sudarshan-Pavan/Motion-Detection.git

Install the required dependencies:

bash

pip install opencv-python

Run the script:

bash

    python motion_detection_Advanced_and_Updated.py

Usage

Once executed, the program captures the video feed from the primary camera. When motion is detected, the affected area is highlighted in the video display.
Future Enhancements

Potential improvements include:

    Alert System: Integrating notifications or alarms upon motion detection.
    Multi-Camera Support: Expanding the project to support multiple video feeds.
    Sensitivity Control: Adding adjustable parameters to fine-tune motion sensitivity.

Conclusion

This project highlights my skills in computer vision, video processing, and Python programming. With a clear structure and ample room for future enhancement, itâ€™s a robust foundation for real-world motion detection applications.
